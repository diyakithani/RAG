X, formerly known as Twitter,[c] is an American microblogging and social networking service. It is one of the world's largest social media platforms and one of the most-visited websites.[10][11] Users can share short text messages, images, and videos in short posts (commonly and unofficially known as "tweets") and like other users' content.[12] The platform also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, Grok chatbot integration, job search,[13] and a social audio feature (X Spaces). Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature.

The platform, then called twttr, was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, and was launched in July of that year; it was renamed Twitter some months later. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million daily tweets.[14] Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world.[15] A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023.[16] 10% of users produce over 80% of tweets.[17][18] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans.[19]

The service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation[20][21][22] and hate speech.[23][24][25] Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology officer.[26][27][28] In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to "X" and the bird logo would be retired, a process which was completed by May 2024.[29][30] In March 2025, X Corp. was acquired by xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company. The deal, an all-stock transaction, valued X at $33 billion, with a full valuation of $45 billion when factoring in $12 billion in debt. Meanwhile, xAI itself was valued at $80 billion.[31][32] In July 2025, Linda Yaccarino stepped down from her role as CEO.[33]

A sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey, envisioning an SMS-based social network
Jack Dorsey claims to have introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate to a small group in 2006.[34] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[35] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[36] Work on the project started in February 2006.[37]

The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees.[37] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[38] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo from the investors and shareholders.[39] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[40] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[41] The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[42]

The company experienced rapid initial growth thereafter. In 2009, Twitter won the "Breakout of the Year" Webby Award.[43][44] In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.[45] By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications.[46] In June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter.[47] As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.[48]

From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out "New Twitter", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites, including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface.[49] In 2019, Twitter was announced to be the 10th most downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[49]

On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday by announcing that it had 140 million users, a 40% rise from September 2011, who were sending 340 million tweets per day.[50][51] On June 5, 2012, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter.[52][53] On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users.[citation needed] In September 2013, the company's data showed that 200 million users sent over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% of tweets sent from mobile devices.[54]

In April 2014, Twitter underwent a redesign that made the site resemble Facebook somewhat, with a profile picture and biography in a column left to the timeline, and a full-width header image with parallax scrolling effect.[d][55] Late in 2015, it became apparent that growth had slowed, according to Fortune,[56] Business Insider,[57] Marketing Land[58] and other news websites including Quartz (in 2016).[59] In 2019, Twitter released another redesign of its user interface.[60] By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[61] Twitter then experienced considerable growth during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.[62] The platform also was increasingly used for misinformation related to the pandemic.[63] Twitter started marking tweets which contained misleading information, and adding links to fact-checks.[64]

In 2021, Twitter began the research phase of Bluesky, an open source decentralized social media protocol where users can choose which algorithmic curation they want.[65][66] The same year, Twitter also released Twitter Spaces, a social audio feature;[67][68] "super follows", a way to subscribe to creators for exclusive content;[69] and a beta of "ticketed Spaces", which makes access to certain audio rooms paid.[70] Twitter unveiled a redesign in August 2021, with adjusted colors and a new Chirp font, which improves the left-alignment of most Western languages.

The original version of the X logo
These paragraphs are an excerpt from Twitter under Elon Musk.[edit]
Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter in October 2022; Musk acted as CEO of Twitter until June 2023 when he was succeeded by Linda Yaccarino.[71][72] Twitter was rebranded to X on July 23, 2023,[73] and its domain name changed from twitter.com to x.com on May 17, 2024.[74] Yaccarino resigned on July 9, 2025.[75]

Now operating as X, the platform closely resembles its predecessor but includes additional features such as long-form texts,[76] account monetization options,[77] audio-video calls,[78] integration with xAI's Grok chatbot,[79] job search,[80] and a repurposing of the platform's verification system as a subscription premium.[81] Several legacy Twitter features were removed from the site after Musk acquired Twitter, including Circles,[82] NFT profile pictures,[83] and the experimental pronouns in profiles feature.[84] Musk's aims included transforming X into a "digital town square" and an "everything app" akin to WeChat.[85]

X has faced significant controversy post-rebranding. Issues such as the release of the Twitter Files, suspension of ten journalists' accounts, and labeling media outlets as "state-affiliated" and restricting their visibility have sparked criticism.[86][87] Despite Musk stepping down as CEO, X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral misinformation,[88] hate speech (especially antisemitism), and child pornography.[89][90][91] In response to allegations it deemed unfair, X Corp. has pursued legal action against nonprofit organizations Media Matters and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.[86][92]

Tweets were publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to their followers. Users can mute users they do not wish to interact with, block accounts from viewing their posts, and remove accounts from their followers list.[93][94][95] Users can post via the Twitter website, compatible external applications, or by Short Message Service (SMS).[96] Users may subscribe to other users' posts—this is known as "following" and subscribers are known as "followers"[97] or "tweeps", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps.[98] Posts can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process commonly called a "retweet" (officially "repost"). In 2015, Twitter launched "quote tweet",[99] a feature (now named "quote repost") which allows users to add a comment to their post, imbedding one post in the other.[100] Users can also "like" individual tweets.[101]

The counters for likes, retweets, and replies appear next to the respective buttons in timelines such as on profile pages and search results. Counters for likes and reposts exist on a post's standalone page too. Since 2020, quote tweets have their own counter.[99] Until the legacy desktop front end that was discontinued in 2020, a row with miniature profile pictures of up to ten liking or retweeting users was displayed, as well as a tweet reply counter next to the according button on a tweet's page.[102][103]

Twitter allows users to update their profile via their phones either by text messaging or by apps.[104] Twitter announced in a tweet in 2022, that the ability to edit a tweet was being tested for select users. Eventually, all Twitter Blue subscribers would be able to use the feature.[105] Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags – words or phrases prefixed with a "#" sign. Similarly, the "@" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users.[106] In 2014, Twitter introduced hashflags, special hashtags that automatically generate a custom emoji next to them for a period of time.[107] Hashflags may be generated by Twitter themselves[108] or purchased by corporations.[109] To repost a message from another user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the repost button within the post. Users can reply to other accounts' replies. Users can hide replies to their messages and select who can reply to each of their tweets before sending them: anyone, accounts who follow the post's author, specific accounts, or none.[110][111]

The original, strict 140 character limit was gradually relaxed. In 2016, Twitter announced that attachments, links, and media such as photos, videos, and the person's handle, would no longer count.[112][113] In 2017, Twitter handles were similarly excluded[114] and Twitter doubled its character limitation to 280.[115] Under the new limit, glyphs are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from.[115] From 2023 Twitter Blue users could create posts with up to 4,000 characters in length.[116]

t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter.[117] It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not general use.[117] All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper.[118] Twitter intended the service to protect users from malicious sites,[117] and to use it to track clicks on links within tweets.[117][119]

In June 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com.[120] Users now have the ability to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet.[121] Twitter plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.[121] In 2016 Twitter introduced the ability to add a caption of up to 480 characters to each image attached to a tweet,[122][123] accessible via screen reading software or by hovering the mouse above a picture inside TweetDeck. In 2022, Twitter made the ability to add and view captions globally available. Descriptions can be added to any uploaded image with a limit of 1000 characters. Images that have a description will feature a badge that says ALT in the bottom left corner, which will bring up the description when clicked.[124]

In 2015, Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets. Polls are open for up to 7 days, and voters are not identified.[125] In Twitter's early years, users could communicate with Twitter using SMS. Twitter discontinued this in most countries in 2023, after hackers exposed vulnerabilities.[126][127]

Multimedia content
In 2016, Twitter began to place a larger focus on live streaming video programming, hosting events including streams of the Republican and Democratic conventions,[128] and winning a bid for non-exclusive streaming rights to ten NFL games in 2016.[129][130] In 2017, Twitter announced that it planned to construct a 24-hour streaming video channel hosted within the service, featuring content from various partners.[129][131] Twitter announced a number of new and expanded partnerships for its streaming video services at the event, including Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, Cheddar, IMG Fashion, Live Nation Entertainment, Major League Baseball, MTV and BET, NFL Network, the PGA Tour, The Players' Tribune, Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens' Propagate, The Verge, Stadium and the WNBA.[132] as of the first quarter of 2017, Twitter had over 200 content partners, who streamed over 800 hours of video over 450 events.[132]

Twitter Spaces is a social audio feature that enables users to host or participate in a live-audio virtual environment called space for conversation. A maximum of 13 people are allowed onstage. The feature was initially limited to users with at least 600 followers, but since October 2021, any Twitter user can create a Space.[133]

In March 2020, Twitter began to test a stories feature known as "fleets" in some markets,[134][135] which officially launched on November 17, 2020.[136][137] Fleets could contain text and media, are only accessible for 24 hours after they are posted, and are accessed within the Twitter app;[134] Twitter announced it would start implementing advertising into fleets in June 2021.[138] Fleets were removed in August 2021; Twitter had intended for fleets to encourage more users to tweet regularly, but instead they were generally used by already-active users.[139]
